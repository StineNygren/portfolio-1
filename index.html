            I'm currently studying to become a front-end developer at Noroff
            School of Technology. It's a two-year program, and I'll be
            graduating by summer 2024. During this course, I'll learn all the
            important coding languages and also get hands-on experience with
            UI/UX design. What I enjoy most about front-end development is that
            it lets me work on problem-solving in my code while also being
            visually creative with the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before becoming a student, I worked as a hairdresser for seven
            years, and I still work part-time in that field while studying.
            Although it's quite different from what I'm learning now, I've
            gained valuable skills and developed a strong work ethic during my
            time as a hairdresser and from previous work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that merging my background in hairdressing with my passion
            for technology brings a unique perspective to my work as a front-end
            developer. I approach challenges with enthusiasm and dedication,
            always striving to find innovative solutions and create
            user-friendly experiences.

              For this project, I undertook the task of creating a coffee-themed
              blog, inspired by my love for coffee. I designed the site,
              incorporating colors that complement the coffee aesthetic. The
              structure and font of the site were chosen with a focus of
              providing an engaging and user-friendly experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built the website from scratch.
              To retrieve and display blog posts, I created a custom API within
              WordPress. This allowed me to integrate the blog posts through my
              page. The website is fully responsive, adapting to different
              screen sizes and devices.

              In this project, my objective was to create a website for a
              science museum with a primary focus on engaging children. With
              this in mind, I carefully designed the site to incorporate the
              fascinating world of science while embracing the playful nature of
              children.
            </p>
            <p>
              The entire website was built using HTML and CSS, ensuring all the
              necessary functionality while keeping it lightweight. The website
              is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and
              devices.

              The Rainydays project is an e-commerce website that sells various
              jackets. I designed the site with a minimalist aesthetic, for easy
              navigation. This project holds a special significance as it is my
              first project in website development.
            </p>
            <p>
              First built using HTML and CSS, I later added a WordPress API and
              JavaScript to update the site's capabilities. The website is fully
              responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
